# Latent Curve Model with Structured Residuals
## A tutorial by Jen Traver and Patrick Curran

### Overview
The LCM-SR is a structural equation model used to disaggregate the between- and within-person effects of two constructs as they unfold over time. The ability to disaggregate levels of effects is extremely desirable, as it allows researchers to more accurately and fully test their hypotheses. This tutorial will provide a practical introduction to the parameterization and application of the LCM-SR including: 
  
*	Background on the parameterization of the LCM-SR
  
*	Strategies for model building
  
*	How to fit an LCM-SR in R or MPlus
    
*	Interpreting the results of an LCM-SR     
  
***Note: The current tutorial assumes a baseline understanding of the SEM framework and latent curve models (LCMs, also referred to as latent growth models, latent growth curve models, etc.).*** If you are not familiar with these topics, there are several free resources where you can begin including CenterStatâ€™s free introduction to SEM workshop and YouTube playlist dedicated to growth modeling.
